\ This is partially a staging ground for new primitives, since it's easier to
\ implement them here than in rust.

Not: ~- 1
NoMatch: == Not
Has: ? < p#
In: ~Has
HasAny: `In \>:
AnyIn: ~HasAny

Less: P #: .(`== Not)

Drop: P # .(Q - p#)

Cut_2: { 0,(y?->is+1) '(X Drop P # ~-) (is,(y#)) }

\ We need p(#0) because [] and "" don't match (maybe they should)
split splitAny: (==) in '{P Cut_2 `X Less p(#0)}
